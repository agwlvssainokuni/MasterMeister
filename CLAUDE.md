# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Master Data Maintenance Application - a Single Page Application (SPA) for maintaining master data stored in an RDBMS. **Phase 4 Complete: MVP Successfully Delivered** - All core functionality operational with comprehensive E2E testing validation.

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend & Backend Stack:**
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.5 with Java 21
- Frontend: React 19 with Node.js 22
- Database: JPA for internal DB, connection pooling for target RDBMS
- Date/Time: java.time API for RDBMS operations

**Database Architecture:**
- Internal DB: Application operational data
- Target RDBMS: Master data to be maintained
- Uses connection pooling instead of DriverManager.getConnection()

## Core Application Features

**User Management:**
- User registration with email confirmation
- Administrator approval workflow
- Role-based authentication

**Database Configuration:**
- Admin dashboard for RDBMS connection setup
- Schema update operations to read table/view structures
- Granular access permissions (table-level and column-level)
- YAML-based permission import/export

**Master Data Maintenance:**
- Table/view listing with access control (Backend API ✅)
- Record listing with pagination and filtering (Backend API ✅)
- In-place record editing with transaction management (Backend API ✅)
- CRUD operations based on permissions (Backend API ✅)
- Single unified API for all operations (Backend API ✅)
- Frontend UI implementation (✅ Complete)

**Query Features:**
- Visual query builder with tab interface (SELECT, FROM, JOIN, WHERE, etc.)
- Named query storage (public/private)
- Parameterized query support using ":param" format
- Query execution history with comprehensive logging
- SQL parsing and reverse engineering

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Use NamedParameterJdbcTemplate for parameterized queries
- Implement proper transaction management for all operations
- Comprehensive audit logging for all database operations
- Access control enforcement at both table and column levels

## Code Organization Principles

**Context/Provider Pattern:**
- All React contexts follow single-file pattern (Context + Provider + Hook)
- Example: AuthContext.tsx, NotificationContext.tsx
- Avoids file fragmentation and improves maintainability

**Route Protection:**
- Use ProtectedRoute.tsx for all authentication logic
- AdminRoute is exported from ProtectedRoute.tsx (not separate file)
- Centralized authentication prevents code duplication

**Design System:**
- CSS variables use 4px-based spacing scale
- Values: xs(4px), sm(8px), md(12px), lg(16px), xl(20px), xxl(24px)
- Follows modern UI library standards (Tailwind CSS compatible)

**Backend Responsibility Separation:**
- Entity layer (entity package) for JPA/Repository operations only
- Model layer (model package) for Service business logic
- DTO layer (controller/dto package) for Controller input/output
- Controller never imports entity package (uses DTO → Model → Entity flow)
- Service never imports dto package (uses Model for all operations)
- Repository never imports dto/model packages (uses Entity only)
- Enums in dedicated package (enums) accessible by all layers

**Frontend Responsibility Separation:**
- Service layer (src/services/) handles all API communication and type conversion
- API types (types/api.ts) are confined to Service layer only
- Frontend types (types/frontend.ts) are used by Components/Pages/Contexts
- Service methods return Frontend types, never expose API Request/Response types
- Type conversion (API ↔ Frontend) must be performed within Service layer

**Build Commands:**
- `./gradlew build` - Build the application
- `./gradlew test` - Run all tests
- `./gradlew bootRun` - Run the application locally
- `docker build -t mastermeister .` - Build Docker image
- **Note**: Add `-Pfrontend` to any Gradle command to include frontend build and integration

**Frontend Commands:**
- `cd frontend && npm run dev` - Run frontend development server
- `cd frontend && npm run build` - Build frontend for production
- `cd frontend && npm run lint` - Run ESLint

**Environment Profiles:**
- `default/dev` - Development with H2 console, verbose logging
- `stg` - Staging with file-based H2, moderate logging
- `prd` - Production with file-based H2, minimal logging
