## MVP Scope Definition

### Core MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)
1. **User Management**: Registration â†’ Admin Approval â†’ Login

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
- **Multi-Database Complexity**: Different SQL dialects and metadata structures
  - *Mitigation*: Start with single database type, expand incrementally
- **Permission System Performance**: Complex permission checks may impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching early, optimize queries

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Single Developer Capacity**: Large scope for single developer
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on MVP first, incremental feature delivery
- **Email Integration**: Development vs production email configuration
  - *Mitigation*: Use profiles and external configuration

---

## Audit Logging Requirements

### Required Audit Events
- [ ] User login/logout with timestamp and IP
- [ ] Admin account approval/rejection
- [ ] RDBMS connection configuration changes
- [ ] Schema import operations
- [ ] Permission configuration changes
- [ ] Large dataset queries (>100 records, configurable threshold)
- [ ] All administrative operations

### Audit Log Format
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format
- **User**: Username or system
- **Action**: Standardized action codes
- **Target**: Resource being operated on
- **Details**: JSON formatted additional information
- **IP Address**: Source IP for security tracking

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Phase 8: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Advanced query optimization and suggestions
- [ ] Data import/export functionality
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Mobile-responsive enhancements
- [ ] API documentation and external integrations
- [ ] Multi-language support
