# MasterMeister

A Master Data Maintenance Single Page Application (SPA) for maintaining master data stored in RDBMS systems.

## Project Overview

MasterMeister is a web-based application designed to provide a secure, user-friendly interface for maintaining master data across multiple database systems. The application features role-based access control, visual query building, and comprehensive audit logging.

- **Visual Query Builder**: Intuitive interface for building complex SQL queries
- **Query Management**: Save, share, and execute parameterized queries
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of user activities and data operations

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Permission-based data access control
- Audit trail for all operations
- Email-based user verification
